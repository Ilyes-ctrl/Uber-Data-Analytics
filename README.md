# Introduction
The growing demand for ride-hailing services like Uber 🚖 generates massive volumes of booking data 📊 that often remain underutilized. Companies face challenges
in understanding ride performance 🏎️, cancellation behavior ❌, customer trends 👥, and payment preferences 💳. This project was designed to address these challenges
by transforming raw ride-booking data 📂 into actionable insights 🔍 through an interactive Power BI dashboard 🖥️. By leveraging advanced visualizations such as KPIs 📌,
trend analyses 📈, cancellation breakdowns 🚫, and payment method distributions 💵, the dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor operations ⚙️, identify pain points 📉,
and improve decision-making 💡. With intuitive navigation 🔘 and slicers 🎛️ for filtering by date 📅 and vehicle type 🚙, the solution empowers managers to evaluate
key performance metrics 📏 and enhance overall operational efficiency 🚀.
