# Introduction
The growing demand for ride-hailing services like Uber 🚖 generates massive volumes of booking data 📊 that often remain underutilized. Companies face challenges
in understanding ride performance 🏎️, cancellation behavior ❌, customer trends 👥, and payment preferences 💳. This project was designed to address these challenges
by transforming raw ride-booking data 📂 into actionable insights 🔍 through an interactive Power BI dashboard 🖥️. By leveraging advanced visualizations such as KPIs 📌,
trend analyses 📈, cancellation breakdowns 🚫, and payment method distributions 💵, the dashboard enables stakeholders to monitor operations ⚙️, identify pain points 📉,
and improve decision-making 💡. With intuitive navigation 🔘 and slicers 🎛️ for filtering by date 📅 and vehicle type 🚙, the solution empowers managers to evaluate
key performance metrics 📏 and enhance overall operational efficiency 🚀.

# Background
### The Questions I Wanted to Answer Through This Project Were:
1. How many total bookings were made, and how many were successfully completed, canceled, or left incomplete?
2. What percentage of bookings are completed, canceled, or incomplete?
3. Who cancels more rides, customers or drivers, and what are the main reasons?
4. How do ride bookings vary over days, weeks, or months?
5. How does driver arrival time compare with trip duration across different hours of the day?
6. Which vehicle types are most popular among riders?
7. How much distance is traveled by each vehicle category?
8. Which vehicle types generate the highest revenue?
9. Why do customers most frequently cancel rides?
10. Why do drivers most frequently cancel rides?
11. Which payment methods are most preferred by customers?
12. What are the busiest pickup areas for rides?
